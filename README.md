# GDOS
Graphical Disk Operating System

GDOS is meant to be a web cartridge player (similar to PICO-8's function) and a program allowing you to work with disks and you own software for
any operating system you want! Well, not really all of them, but, windows, mac, linux, and raspberry pi. GDOS also has a project management page
that you can access through the terminal, and it has access to almost any linux system and any system windows 95 and older.

When you download the program, the application is named "index.html".
